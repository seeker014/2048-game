Here is the score summary for the project:<br><br>
10	Documentation explaining how you implemented your game and how it satisfies the remainder of the requirements. <br>
  this page satisfies this requirement.<br><br>
20	Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript<br>
This is shown on GameGrid.html where the core 2048 grid is, it is stylized with css and can be resized by visiting the index page and changing the size with the select element<br><br>
20	User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons<br>
a restart button is present on the GameGrid page that restarts the game, and there is a select element on the index page that can control the grid size. Both satisfy this requirement<br><br>
20	User input in the form of mouse clicks<br>
lol what?<br><br>
20	Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions<br>
this is done every time the user makes a move, the update() function in script.js (view) uses innerHTML to update the grid to the current state of the grid.<br><br>
20	Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page<br>
data for the world high scores is loaded from highScores.json and displayed below the grid. This is static info loaded from the json file, which many browsers don't support. If your browser doesn't support this, there will be an alert telling you your browser isn't compatible, then the game will run as normal without the world high score table. This was tested to work properly on firefox version 67.0 <br><br>
20	Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage<br>
a players personal high score is loaded from local storage and displayed above the game grid. gridSize preferences are also loaded into local storage.<br><br>
120	Game logic code<br>
Game logic works properly.<br><br>
20	Extra Credit Include a second HTML5 component. If your first HTML5 component is media (audio or video) then your second component can't be a media component.<br>
TODO:<br><br>
